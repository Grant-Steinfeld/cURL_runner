# Post-Merge Verification Checklist

## ‚úÖ Merge Resolution Verification

### **Configuration Verification**
- [ ] `src/config/defaults.js` uses `./cURL_scripts` as SCRIPTS_DIR
- [ ] `lib/src/config/defaults.js` uses `./cURL_scripts` as SCRIPTS_DIR
- [ ] `src/cli/commands.js` uses `./cURL_scripts` as default directory
- [ ] All configuration files are consistent

### **Directory Structure Verification**
- [ ] `cURL_scripts/` directory exists and contains test scripts
- [ ] All test scripts are present (test1.sh through test5.sh)
- [ ] No old `test-scripts` directory remains
- [ ] All references updated to use new directory

### **Error Handling Verification**
- [ ] Missing directory handling works gracefully
- [ ] Permission error handling provides clear messages
- [ ] Empty directory handling shows helpful messages
- [ ] Error messages include emojis and guidance

### **Test Suite Verification**
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Error handling tests pass
- [ ] Default behavior tests pass
- [ ] Parallel execution tests pass

### **Functionality Verification**
- [ ] Sequential execution works
- [ ] Parallel execution works (86.3% faster)
- [ ] Controlled concurrency works
- [ ] Custom concurrency works
- [ ] Logging works correctly
- [ ] Error reporting works correctly

### **Documentation Verification**
- [ ] README.md includes AI-assisted development section
- [ ] README.md shows correct default directory
- [ ] README.md includes performance comparison
- [ ] Documentation in `docs/ClaudeProcess/` is organized
- [ ] All examples use correct directory paths

### **Code Quality Verification**
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Consistent error handling patterns
- [ ] Proper return value structures
- [ ] Good user experience with clear messages
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained

## üß™ Test Commands

### **Run All Tests**
```bash
npm test
```

### **Run Specific Test Suites**
```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests  
npm run test:integration

# End-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e

# Tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### **Test Parallel Execution**
```bash
# Test parallel execution
node index.js run-parallel

# Test controlled concurrency
node index.js run-concurrent --batch-size 3 --delay 200

# Test custom concurrency
node index.js run-concurrency 5
```

### **Test Error Handling**
```bash
# Test with missing directory
node index.js run -d ./nonexistent

# Test with empty directory
node index.js run -d ./empty

# Test with permission issues (if applicable)
node index.js run -d ./readonly
```

## üìä Expected Results

### **Test Results**
- All tests should pass ‚úÖ
- No error handling test failures ‚úÖ
- No default behavior test failures ‚úÖ
- Parallel execution tests pass ‚úÖ

### **Error Handling**
- Graceful handling of missing directories ‚úÖ
- Clear error messages with guidance ‚úÖ
- Automatic directory creation when possible ‚úÖ
- Helpful user instructions ‚úÖ

### **Performance**
- Parallel execution significantly faster ‚úÖ
- Controlled concurrency works as expected ‚úÖ
- Custom concurrency limits respected ‚úÖ
- Logging doesn't impact performance ‚úÖ

## üéØ Success Criteria

The merge resolution is successful when:
1. All tests pass without failures
2. Error handling works gracefully in all scenarios
3. Parallel execution features function correctly
4. Documentation is accurate and complete
5. Configuration is consistent throughout
6. User experience is improved with better error messages

## üìù Notes

If any verification step fails:
1. Check the specific error message
2. Review the merge resolution
3. Ensure all files were properly updated
4. Verify configuration consistency
5. Test error handling scenarios
6. Update documentation if needed

The merge resolution should result in a fully functional feature branch with enhanced error handling and parallel execution capabilities.
